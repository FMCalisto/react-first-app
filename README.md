## Information

This repository is a replication of the [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) tutorial called [Build Your First React.js App](https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-react-js-application). Building the first React application can be challenging. React itself is fairly simple. It has a small API that can be learned quickly. One of the huge challenges when you are getting started with React is all of the other pieces that contribute to creating an application.

## Run

```
cd notetaker
npm install
webpack -w
```
